# Odin-Kittens

Odin-Kittens is a simple app that is both a normal HTML-producing back end and an API that can be used to serve data.  

This is the [Kittens API Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/kittens-api) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
